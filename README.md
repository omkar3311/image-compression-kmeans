# 🎨 Image Compression using KMeans  

## 📌 Overview  
With the rapid growth of digital media, storage and bandwidth requirements for images have increased significantly. While traditional compression methods like **JPEG** or **PNG** are effective, this project explores how **Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning)** can also be applied for image compression.  

We use **K-Means clustering** to reduce the number of unique colors in an image. By grouping similar colors and replacing them with their cluster centroids, the image is reconstructed with fewer colors — achieving compression while maintaining visual quality.

## 🚀 Approach  

1. **Image as Data**  
   - An image is just a collection of pixels.  
   - Each pixel has 3 values: **R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue)**.  
   - Many colors are similar, but stored individually, which increases file size.  

2. **K-Means Clustering**  
   - Each pixel (RGB triplet) is treated as a point in 3D space.  
   - K-Means groups pixels into *k* clusters.  
   - Each cluster is represented by its **centroid color**.  

3. **Reconstruction**  
   - Each pixel is replaced with the centroid color of its cluster.  
   - The new image now has only *k* unique colors.  

4. **Compression Effect**  
   - Instead of storing all original colors, we store:  
     - The *k* centroid colors  
     - A cluster label for each pixel  
   - This reduces storage size while keeping the image visually similar.

## 🎯 Expected Results  

- **Side-by-side comparison**: Original image vs Compressed image  
- **File size difference** before and after compression  
- **Effect of `k`**: trade-off between quality and compression

## 📊 Example  

| Original Image (949.69 KB) | Compressed (k=256)  (8.80 KB) | 
|----------------|-------------------|
| ![original](Original_image.jpg) | ![k16](Compressed_image.jpg) |


- Size saved: 949.69 − 8.80 = 940.89 KB

- Compression ratio: 949.69 / 8.80 ≈ 107.92 : 1
